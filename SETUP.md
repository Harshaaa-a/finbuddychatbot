## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "OPENAI_API_KEY not found"
- Make sure you've created the `.env` file in the `backend` directory
- Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and properly formatted
- Check that you haven't exceeded your free credits

#### "Failed to fetch finance data"
- Verify your Alpha Vantage API key is correct
- You may have hit the daily limit (25 calls/day on free tier)
- The system will use fallback data if APIs fail

#### "Connection refused" errors
- Make sure the backend server is running on port 3001
- Check if another service is using port 3001
- Try changing the port in your `.env` file

#### Frontend can't connect to backend
- Ensure both frontend and backend are running
- Check the console for CORS errors
- Verify the API endpoint URL in ChatInterface.tsx

### Development Tips

1. **Monitor API usage**: Keep an eye on your OpenAI and Alpha Vantage usage
2. **Test fallback responses**: Try disconnecting from the internet to test offline responses
3. **Customize prompts**: Edit `aiService.js` to adjust the AI's personality and expertise
4. **Add more data sources**: Extend `financeService.js` to include additional financial APIs

## Free Tier Limitations

### OpenAI ($5 free credits)
- Approximately 2,500-5,000 chat messages
- Rate limit: 3 requests per minute
- Tokens: 40,000 tokens per minute

### Alpha Vantage (Free tier)
- 25 API calls per day
- 5 calls per minute
- Limited to basic market data

## Scaling Up

When you're ready to scale:

1. **OpenAI**: Add payment method for pay-as-you-go pricing
2. **Alpha Vantage**: Upgrade to premium for more calls
3. **Alternative APIs**: Consider Finnhub, IEX Cloud, or Polygon.io
4. **Database**: Add PostgreSQL or MongoDB to store conversation history
5. **Authentication**: Add user accounts and personalized advice
6. **Caching**: Implement Redis for faster responses

## Support

If you run into issues:
1. Check the server logs for error details
2. Test the API endpoints directly using curl or Postman
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Make sure you're using Node.js version 16 or higher

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your API keys secure and private
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use environment variables in production
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production use
