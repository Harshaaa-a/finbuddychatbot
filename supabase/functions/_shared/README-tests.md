# Message Analyzer Tests

This directory contains unit tests for the message analyzer module that determines whether user queries require current news context.

## Test Files

- `message-analyzer.test.ts` - Deno-based tests for Supabase Edge Functions environment
- `message-analyzer.test.js` - Node.js-based tests for local development

## Running Tests

### Deno Tests (Recommended for Edge Functions)
```bash
deno test supabase/functions/_shared/message-analyzer.test.ts
```

### Node.js Tests (For local development)
```bash
node supabase/functions/_shared/message-analyzer.test.js
```

## Test Coverage

The tests validate the following functionality:

### 1. Keyword Detection (`shouldIncludeNewsContext`)
- Market-related keywords (stock, market, nifty, sensex, etc.)
- Time-sensitive keywords (current, today, latest, recent, etc.)
- News-related keywords (news, updates, headlines, etc.)
- Financial events keywords (earnings, IPO, RBI, etc.)

### 2. Pattern Detection
- Direct news request patterns ("What's happening...", "Any news about...")
- Market condition patterns ("How is the market...", "Should I buy...")
- Current state patterns ("What's current...", "How are stocks today...")

### 3. Question Type Analysis (`analyzeQuestionType`)
- Market queries detection and confidence scoring
- Educational queries detection
- News queries detection
- Company-specific queries detection
- Confidence threshold validation

### 4. Comprehensive Context Analysis (`requiresNewsContext`)
- Integration of keyword detection and question analysis
- Confidence-based decision making
- Edge case handling

## Test Results

Both test suites achieve 100% pass rate with comprehensive coverage of:
- 59 test cases in Node.js version
- 13 test groups in Deno version
- Edge cases including empty/null inputs
- Case insensitivity validation
- False positive detection (educational questions with financial keywords)

## Key Findings

The tests document that the current implementation correctly identifies:

**Should require news context:**
- "What's the latest on the stock market?"
- "Current inflation rate in India"
- "Should I invest in current market conditions?"
- "How is Reliance stock doing today?"

**Should NOT require news context:**
- "How does compound interest work?"
- "What is portfolio diversification?"
- "How to start a SIP?"

**Edge cases (keyword-triggered but educational):**
- "What is a stock?" - triggers due to "stock" keyword
- "What are the basics of budgeting?" - triggers due to "basics" keyword

These edge cases are documented as expected behavior since the keyword-based approach prioritizes recall over precision to ensure users get relevant news context when needed.
