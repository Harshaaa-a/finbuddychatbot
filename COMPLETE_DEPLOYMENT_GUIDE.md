## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues
- **Service won't start**: Check Railway logs
- **Health check fails**: Verify deployment completed
- **CORS errors**: Backend has CORS enabled

### Frontend Issues
- **Build fails**: Check Node.js version (use 18+)
- **Can't connect**: Verify `VITE_API_URL` is set correctly
- **Blank page**: Check browser console for errors

### Common Solutions
- Clear browser cache after deployment
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify URLs don't have trailing slashes
- Check service logs for detailed errors
