# 🔧 Fix Vercel Build Error - "vite: command not found"

## ❌ The Problem
Vercel is getting this error:
```
sh: line 1: vite: command not found
Error: Command "vite build" exited with 127
```

## ✅ The Solution

I've fixed the `vercel.json` configuration. Here's what to do:

### Step 1: Update Your Vercel Project Settings

1. **Go to your Vercel dashboard**
2. **Click on your project**
3. **Go to Settings → General**
4. **Update these settings:**

```
Framework Preset: Vite
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: dist
Install Command: npm install
Node.js Version: 18.x
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

1. **Go to Settings → Environment Variables**
2. **Add this variable:**
   - **Name**: `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com`
   - **Environment**: Production, Preview, Development

### Step 3: Redeploy

1. **Go to Deployments tab**
2. **Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment**
3. **Or push a new commit to trigger redeployment**

## 🔧 Alternative Fix (If Still Not Working)

### Option 1: Manual Vercel Configuration

If the automatic detection isn't working, manually set these in Vercel dashboard:

1. **Framework Preset**: `Vite`
2. **Root Directory**: `.` (leave empty)
3. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
4. **Output Directory**: `dist`
5. **Install Command**: `npm install`
6. **Node.js Version**: `18.x`

### Option 2: Use Netlify Instead (Backup Plan)

If Vercel continues to have issues, Netlify is more reliable for Vite projects:

1. **Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)**
2. **New site from Git → GitHub**
3. **Select your repository**
4. **Build settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Node version: `18`

## 🎯 Why This Happens

The error occurs because:
1. Vercel sometimes doesn't detect Vite projects correctly
2. The build process needs explicit configuration
3. Node.js version might be incompatible

## ✅ Prevention

The updated `vercel.json` file I created should prevent this issue in future deployments.

## 🚀 Quick Fix Commands

If you want to test locally first:

```bash
# Test the build locally
npm run build

# If that works, the issue is just Vercel configuration
# Follow the steps above to fix Vercel settings
```

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If you're still getting errors:

1. **Check Vercel logs** in the deployment details
2. **Try Netlify** as an alternative (more reliable for Vite)
3. **Make sure Node.js version is 18.x** in Vercel settings

**The fix should work now!** 🎉
